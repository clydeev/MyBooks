Now when every virgin’s turn came to go in to the king, after all had been done

And as the time came orderly about, the day was at hand, when Esther, the
daughter of Abihail the brother of Mardochai, whom he had adopted for his
daughter, was to go in to the king. But she sought not women’s ornaments, but
