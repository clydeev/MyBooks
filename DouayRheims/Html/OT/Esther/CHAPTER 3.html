After these things, king Assuerus advanced Aman, the son of Amadathi, who was

And when they were saying this often, and he would not hearken to them, they

Now when Aman had heard this, and had proved by experience that Mardochai did

And he counted it nothing to lay his hands upon Mardochai alone: for he had
heard that he was of the nation of the Jews, and he chose rather to destroy all

In the first month (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of
Assuerus, the lot was cast into an urn, which in Hebrew is called Phur, before
Aman, on what day and what month the nation of the Jews should be destroyed:
and there came out the twelfth month, which is called Adar.</span></p>

And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people scattered through all the
provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, that use new laws and
ceremonies, and moreover despise the king’s ordinances: and thou knowest very
well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they should grow insolent by
impunity.</span></p>

And the king took the ring that he used, from his own hand, and gave it to

And the king’s scribes were called in the first month Nisan, on the thirteenth
day of the same month: and they wrote, as Aman had commanded, to all the king’s

every nation could read, and hear according to their different languages, in
the name of king Assuerus: and the letters, sealed with his ring,</span></p>
