On that day king Assuerus gave the house of Aman, the Jews’ enemy, to queen
Esther, and Mardochai came in before the king. For Esther had confessed to him

And not content with these things, she fell down at the king’s feet and wept,

And king Assuerus answered Esther the queen, and Mardochai the Jew: I have

his ring.</span></p>

Then the king’s scribes and secretaries were called for (now it was the time of
the third month which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day of the month,
and letters were written, as Mardochai had a mind, to the Jews, and to the
governors, and to the deputies, and to the judges, who were rulers over the
hundred and twenty-seven provinces, from India even to Ethiopia: to province

And in all peoples, cities, and provinces, whithersoever the king’s
