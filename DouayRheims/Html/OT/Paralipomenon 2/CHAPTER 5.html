And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the Lord into its place,
that is, to the oracle of the temple, into the holy of holies under the wings

Now when the priests were come out of the sanctuary, (for all the priests that
could be found there, were sanctified: and as yet at that time the courses and

Both the Levites and the singing men, that is, both they that were under Asaph,
and they that were under Heman, and they that were under Idithun, with their
sons, and their brethren, clothed with fine linen, sounded with cymbals, and
psalteries, and harps, standing on the east side of the altar, and with them a
hundred and twenty priests, sounding with trumpets.</span></p>

So when they all sounded together, both with trumpets, and voice, and cymbals,
and organs, and with divers kind of musical instruments, and lifted up their
voice on high: the sound was heard afar off, so that when they began to praise
the Lord, and to say: Give glory to the Lord for he is good, for his mercy
endureth for ever: the house of God was filled with a cloud.</span></p>

Nor could the priests stand and minister by reason of the cloud. For the glory
of the Lord had filled the house of God.</span></p>
