Then one of the lords, upon whose hand the king leaned, answering the man of
God, said: If the Lord should make flood-gates in heaven, can that possibly be

If we will enter into the city, we shall die with the famine: and if we will

So they arose in the evening, to go to the Syrian camp. And when they were come
to the first part of the camp of the Syrians, they found no man there.</span></p>

For the Lord had made them hear, in the camp of Syria, the noise of chariots,
and of horses, and of a very great army, and they said one to another: Behold

Egyptians, and they are come upon us.</span></p>

Wherefore they arose, and fled away in the dark, and left their tents, and

So when these lepers were come to the beginning of the camp, they went into one
tent, and ate and drank: and they took from thence silver, and gold, and
raiment, and went, and hid it: and they came again, and went into another tent,
and carried from thence in like manner, and hid it.</span></p>

Then they said one to another: We do not well: for this is a day of good

And he arose in the night and said to his servants: I tell you what the Syrians
have done to us: They know that we suffer great famine, and therefore they are
gone out of the camp, and lie hid in the fields, saying: When they come out of
