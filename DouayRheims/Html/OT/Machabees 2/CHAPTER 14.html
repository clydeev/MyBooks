and to set fire to it, when he was ready to be taken, he struck himself with
his sword:</span></p>

Choosing to die nobly rather than to fall into the hands of the wicked, and to
suffer abuses unbecoming his noble birth.</span></p>

But whereas through haste he missed of giving himself a sure wound, and the
crowd was breaking into the doors, he ran boldly to the wall, and manfully
threw himself down to the crowd:</span></p>

And as he had yet breath in him, being inflamed in mind he arose: and while his
blood ran down with a great stream, and he was grievously wounded, he ran
through the crowd:</span></p>

And standing upon a steep rock, when he was now almost without blood, grasping
his bowels with both hands, he cast them upon the throng, calling upon the Lord
of life and spirit, to restore these to him again: and so he departed this
life.</span></p>
