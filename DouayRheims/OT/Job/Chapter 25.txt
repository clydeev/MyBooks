Title: The Book of Job
Chapter 25
1 Then Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:
2 Power and terror are with him, who maketh peace in his high places.
3 Is there any numbering of his soldiers? and upon whom shall not his light arise?
4 Can men be justified compared with God, or he that is born of a women appear clean?
5 Behold even the moon doth not shine, and the stars are not pure in his sight.
6 How much less man that is rottenness and the son of man who is a worm?
