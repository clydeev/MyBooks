Title: The Book of Psalms
Psalm 130
A gradual canticle of David.
1 Lord, my heart is not exalted: nor are my eyes lofty.
2 Neither have I walked in great matters, nor in wonderful things above me. If I was not humbly minded, but exalted my soul: As a child that is weaned is towards his mother, so reward in my soul.
3 Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth now and for ever.
