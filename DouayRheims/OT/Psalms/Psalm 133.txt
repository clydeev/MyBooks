Title: The Book of Psalms
Psalm 133
A gradual canticle.
1 Behold now bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord:
2 Who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. In the nights lift up your hands to the holy places, and bless ye the Lord.
3 May the Lord out of Sion bless thee, he that made heaven and earth.
