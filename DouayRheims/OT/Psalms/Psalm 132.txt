Title: The Book of Psalms
Psalm 132
A gradual canticle of David.
1 Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity:
2 Like the precious ointment on the head, that ran down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron, Which ran down to the skirt of his garment:
3 as the dew of Hermon, which descendeth upon mount Sion. For there the Lord hath commanded blessing, and life for evermore.
